# Customer Journey Master
Customer Journey Master is a Web Management Application written by Python's Django webframework, targeting small and medium businesses, assisting them in collecting and managing customer journey data from multiple sources and channels in one place, analyzing and exploiting the journey based on Process Mining and Machine Learning techniques.

## Main Functions
  1. Create data sources (dataset) for analyzing customer journey data
  2. Import customer journey data into data sources by uploading CSV Files (limit 15 MB for each upload file)
  3. Import customer journey data into data sources by pre-defined RestfulAPI endpoint
  4. Visualize the entire customer journey based on Process Mining Algorithms, including: Alpha Miner, Heuristic Miner and Inductive Miner
  5. Cluster customer journeys into similar groups based on Clustering Algorithms, including: KMeans and KModes
  6. Find decision points that influence customers' choices through the entire process based on Decision Tree Algorithm
  7. Store analytical results and review
  8. View daily metrics reports by charts
